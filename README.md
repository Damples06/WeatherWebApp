I'm happy to share that I'm currently working on a Weather Web App using Java and the Spring Framework. I'm getting real-time data from MGM to create a strong backend for accurate weather information.


My main goal in this project is to learn the Vaadin Framework and improve the user interface, making it easier for everyone. Stay tuned for updates as I keep making progress on this project. Exciting times ahead! ðŸš€
